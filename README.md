# Online-Gomoku-Game
This is a network project, using C# to build a network gomoku game. The basic rule of gomoku is that the winner makes his/her pieces connected in a line with length as least 5 faster than his/her opponent does. That is the fundamental rule applied in this project. Additionally, there is a rule in this project that you will lose your turn if you do not make your decision in 30 seconds.
