# Online Gomoku Game
This is a network project, using C# to build a network gomoku game. The basic rule of gomoku is that the winner makes his/her pieces connected in a line with length as least 5 faster than his/her opponent does. That is the fundamental rule applied in this project. Additionally, there is a rule in this project that you will lose your turn if you do not make your decision in 30 seconds. By the way, the server can only deal with one client at the same time.

# Begin the game
To start the game, you first need to copy the folder 'FFOutput' to your C drive so that the program can find the bmp file it needs, and that folder is also the path where the program create a client's record. It is available to change this setting if you want. Then you can start both server and client programs. First, turn on the server by clicking "Server On" button at server side. Second, key in a name in the textbox and confirm, then you can click "Client On" button to start a fantastic gomoku game.
